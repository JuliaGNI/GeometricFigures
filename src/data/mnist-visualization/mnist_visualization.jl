"""
    force_render!(figure)

Render `figure` once, discarding the result.

Each figure below is saved as the *child scene* of its `Axis` rather than as the figure, which is
what makes the images tightly cropped and free of figure padding. A child scene of a figure that has
never been rendered has no content, so `CairoMakie.save` on it writes a fully transparent image —
the render pass is what this call is for, and it has to happen before the `Axis` is added.

This used to be `display(fig)`, from when the script ran under GLMakie and displaying a figure and
then drawing into the live window was the idiom. CairoMakie has no interactive backend, so `display`
falls through to the file-based show stack, which writes a temporary image and hands it to the system
viewer: 34 Preview windows on macOS on every documentation build, every one of them blank, because
the call sits between `Figure()` and the `plot_image!` that fills it.

`colorbuffer` is the same render pass without the display stack, and is pixel-identical to what
`display` produced — verified over all 34 images. `Makie.update_state_before_display!` is *not* a
substitute despite the name: it leaves the child scenes empty and the saved images blank.
